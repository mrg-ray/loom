// In-loop full-collapse fold. When the context estimate crosses the start
// mark, the conversation loop appends ONE transient user message — the fold
// instruction — to the next call. The model answers with a JSON summary; the
// harness performs the collapse mechanically. The model's only contribution
// is the summary text: the fold range is the harness's (full collapse), the
// excision is the harness's, and the fold reply itself is never stored,
// streamed onward, or returned — from outside, the session just got shorter.
//
// The summariser is the agent itself, mid-state, on its own warm cache —
// testimony, not archaeology: no separate compressor call re-reading the
// region at full input rate, no lock released across a network call, no
// second prompt path. The compressor subsystem remains only as the failsafe
// (ReleasePressure), which runs when the in-loop fold has failed.
//
// What survives a collapse: prompt/ROM, the summary (L2), the operator's
// user rows verbatim, the assistant TEXT of the newest K turns (call/result
// pairs stripped whole — both sides always), and the pending pair. All tool
// calls and results outside the pending pair are excised: the summary has
// just harvested every conclusion, and what remains of old tool traffic is
// snapshot — re-fetchable, stale, and heavy.

Context maintenance: summarise the work so far. Reply with ONLY this JSON —
no other text, no tool calls:

{"summary": "<the state of the work>"}

Write for one reader: yourself, continuing this work with nothing but this
summary and your most recent turns. Everything you write should serve the
remaining work; everything that serves nothing ahead is dropped.

A session summary is already in context. It is the complete record of
everything before your recent turns, and what you write now REPLACES it.
Carry forward everything in it that still serves the work; whatever you omit
is gone for good. Fold the recent turns into it — do not summarise them alone.

Write the current state in the present tense — never the story of how it got
here. Keep, in this order: the operator's instructions and rulings, verbatim
where the wording carries force; decisions with their rationale; approaches
ruled out, each with its reason; constraints and facts discovered about this
environment (schemas, conventions, paths, gotchas); where the work stands —
done, in hand, next. Identifiers and paths as pointers — never file contents
or query results; anything re-fetchable is one cheap call away, and a stale
copy is worse than none.

Drop without trace: every superseded value (only the current version of any
fact may appear); corrected errors (the correction survives, the error does
not); raw results already reduced to a conclusion; exploration that led
nowhere unless it closed a door — then it is a ruled-out line with its
reason. Do not invent facts not present in the conversation.
